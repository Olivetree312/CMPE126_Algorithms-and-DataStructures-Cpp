SETTINGS:
- 4 quadrant coordinate system NOT the same as 2D array
	-> assume we are only using Q1 (+x,+y)
	-> print 2D array with R1 at bottom
	-> assume bottom left corner (0,0) 
	-> need function to check when out of bounds (x or y <0)

REQUIREMENTS:
- move
- undo (stack)
- redo (stack)
- print history of ops
	-> need vector to track ops

UNDO & REDO:
- DON'T call move because it pushes ops back onto undoStack
	-> perform moves manually within each function
- using stacks
	-> push all ops onto undo stack
	-> when undo() -> pop from undo(0), push onto redo()
	-> when new op performed -> clear redo()
- pop undo -> push redo:
	-> pop() -> perform inverse of op (l <-> r) (u <-> d)
	-> push() ONTO redo (so what was undone can be redone)

MAZE SOLVER:
- assume 1 = wall to right -> cannot move r
- assume 0 = no floor below -> cannot move to square
- can move left as long as in bounds (0<x-1 && x-1<cols)
- can move right if in bounds & no wall (x+1<cols && no wall)
- can move down if in bounds
- can move up if in bounds

- need some sort of maze solver recursive algorithm
