Goal: impliment queue using stack objects
- stack --> FILO & LIFO
- queue --> FIFO & LILO
- ONLY stacks may store queue elements
- stack functions: push, pop, top, empty, size

stackQueue object has:
public: enqueue, dequeue, front, size, maxSize, isEmpty, isFull
private: 2 stacks

method:
- use stack1 for enqueue operations
- use stack2 to hold elements when dequeueing

functions:
- enqueue (adds elem to back of queue)
	~ back of queue = top of stack
	~ push elem onto stack1
- dequeue (removes elem from front of queue, returns ref to front elem)
	~ front of queue = bottom of stack --> how to access?
	~ "pour" stack1 into stack2 so that front = stack2.top()
	~ pop stack2.top() to remove front
	~ "pour" stack2 back into stack1 so that stack1 front is at bottom
- front (returns ref to front elem)
	~ copy assign stack1 to stack2
	~ while stack2 is not empty, get top, then pop
	~ return most recent top elem
- size (returns num elem in queue)
	~ use stack function size()
- maxSize (returns capacity)
- isEmpty (returns T if size is 0)
- isFull (returns T if at capacity)
