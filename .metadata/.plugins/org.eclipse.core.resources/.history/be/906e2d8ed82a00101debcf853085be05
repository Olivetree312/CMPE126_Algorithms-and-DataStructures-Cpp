TASK 1:
- used cout to debug
- error: was comparing the whole Student object to string
- fix: get member of Student to compare to string
- printed list to display zero-based indices
- ALSO: check for file existence
	- PROBLEM: students.txt needs to be under project folder, NOT src folder

TASK 2:
- method: use basicSearch as helper function for searchAll
	- using basicSearch to find first occurance of last name
		->then incrementing index until different last name
	- continuing to use helper functions for other search algorithms
		in order to print all duplicate last names

TASK 3:
- in order to determine if name at index is less than or equal to target:
	-> get index value of first letter of last names and compare
	-> have separate variables for indices and value of first letter at index
- ternary search is similar to binary search but keeping track of 2 mids
	-> recursive function with base case low > high
	- (binary function uses while loop)
