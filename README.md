## Course Information

**CMPE 126 – Algorithms and Data Structure Design**  

Key topics covered in the course include:
- Object-oriented data organization
- Strings and arrays
- Stacks, queues, and deques
- Lists, sets, trees, and graphs
- Tables and associative structures
- Sorting and searching algorithms
- Algorithm design and performance analysis

---

## Repository Contents

This repository includes:
- Programming assignments
- Larger design-oriented projects
- Supporting files and test code

Assignments vary in scope, ranging from focused data structure implementations to more open-ended projects exploring system design and algorithmic trade-offs.

## Tools & Technologies

- **C++** (primary language)
- Object-oriented programming principles
- Standard data structure implementations
- Algorithm analysis techniques

---

## Learning Focus

The primary goals of these projects were to:
- Apply data structures to real programming problems
- Design reusable and extensible class hierarchies
- Analyze time and space complexity
- Develop problem-solving strategies grounded in algorithmic principles
